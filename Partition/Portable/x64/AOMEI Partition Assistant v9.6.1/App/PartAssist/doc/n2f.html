	NTFS to FAT32 Converter is a professional file system conversion utility. It allows you to convert file system from NTFS to FAT32 (vice versa) without erasing data and converting NTFS partition which is larger than 32GB to FAT32 is no longer a problem.

        <li>When converting NTFS to FAT32, you have to copy any single files whose size are greater than 4GB to any other proper place due to FAT32 file system doesn't support it. </li>
