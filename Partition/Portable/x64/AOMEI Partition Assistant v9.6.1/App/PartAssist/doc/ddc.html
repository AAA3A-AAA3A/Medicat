	<div style="background-color:#CCDDEE; border: 1px solid #999999; padding:10px;"><strong>Note</strong>: <br>
	  Due to the characteristic of basic disk, Dynamic Disk Converter cannot directly convert the spanned, striped, mirror and RAID volume to basic partition. Therefore you need to use Method 2 to convert them to basic partition.
