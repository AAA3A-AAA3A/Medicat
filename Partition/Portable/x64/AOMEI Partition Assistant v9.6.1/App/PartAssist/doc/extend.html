	Extend Partition Wizard is a useful utility, which is able to extend your system boot partition and other partitions. It can fully use the free space and unallocated space on the disk to meet your needs. The program automatically shrinks large partitions and moves them to release more space to increase the capacity for the given partition. It's easy and safe without loss of data, without formatting partition and without restarting computer.
