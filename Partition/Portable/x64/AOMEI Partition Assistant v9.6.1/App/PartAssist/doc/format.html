	Format is designed to change the file system or cluster size of the partition in order to re-arrange the format of the stored data, but the original format and data will be destroyed.<br/><br/>
	<b>To Format Partition</b><br/>
	<ul style="list-style:decimal;">
		<li>Select the partition that you want to format in main window, and click the <b>Format</b> command in shortcut menu to invoke the Format Partition dialog.<br/><br/></li>
		<li>In the dialog, enter the partition label, and select a file system of your desired (e.g. FAT32 or NTFS). For the cluster size (with Default, 512 bytes, 1, 2, 4â€¦ 64 KB), having selected Default, Partition Assistant will automatically determine the cluster size depending on selected file system and partition size, and the Default option is recommended.<br/><br/></li>
		<li>
			By clicking OK a partition formatting operation will be added to pending operations list.
		</li>
	</ul>

		<b>Note</b><br/>
		<ul>
			<li>Partition formatting destroys all its data, including files and folders! Take special care when performing the operation.</li>
			<li>The smaller of the cluster size may let your partition generate many file fragments during the process of the data read-write. The bigger cluster may waste less disk space. We suggest you use this default value.</li>
			<li>If you may need to save some big files greater than 4GB to the partition, we suggest use NTFS to format due to the 4GB limitation of FAT32.</li>
