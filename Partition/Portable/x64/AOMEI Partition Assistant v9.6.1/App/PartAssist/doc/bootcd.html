        AOMEI Partition Assistant will detect and integrate all necessary drivers of the current system automatically when creating the bootable device. There will be a pop-up window with the list of these drivers and asking if you want to integrate them.
      </li>
      <li>
        AOMEI Partition Assistant also allows you to manually add additional drivers when creating the bootable device.
      </li>
      <li>
        When creating a bootable CD/USB device, AOMEI Partition Assistant needs to format the CD/USB device. If there is important data on it, please make a backup and redo.
