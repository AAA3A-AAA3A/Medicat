Menu Changes:
# I have completely pain-stakingly rewritten ventoy.json, so that anyone can drop in a new updated .IMG, .ISO, .VHD, or .EFI file and rename it in the folder. This means you no longer have to edit ventoy.json when updating your bootable files.
# As a result of the re-write above, the folder structure has also changed to not only take advantage of the new menu, but also in aiding users with tooltips under the menu, giving descriptions of the tools, and telling users wether the tool supports BIOS, UEFI, or both.
# Backup_and_Restore has been renamed to Backup_and_Recovery.
# Boot_an_Operating_System has been renamed Live_Operating_Systems.
# A few icons have been adjusted, and a new icon for UEFI files has been made.
# Version info has been updated.
# New Wallpaper
# Added a holiday hat to the mascot.



Other Misc. Changes:
% The Driverpacks in USB:\PortableApps\SnappyDriverInstaller\Drivers\ have been repacked with the latest 64-bit Windows 10 drivers (and all others removed.)
% The latest storage drivers have been integrated into Mini Windows 10's .wim file.
% A new desktop icon is on the Mini Windows 10 desktop, taking the user to the new MediCat website. (medicatusb.xyz)



Fixes:
* The Malwarebytes Bootable WinPE now boots up Malwarebytes v2.2.1.1043, and completes virus scans without crashing. (Please see the _READ_ME!_.txt file at USB:\Programs\MalwarebytesPortable\ for more information.) Thanks @Gremlin220366#4797 for the new Malwarebytes Portable build!
* Fixed the Wallpaper setter so it sets the wallpaper properly in Mini Windows 10. It sometimes wouldn't set in VMware testing, and has been fixed within pecmd.ini.
* Also fixed Rainmeter not launching in certain instances.
* Further improvements to overall system stability and other minor adjustments have been made to enhance the user experience.
