Medicat USB does not have windows installation images by default. To add one, you just have to drag iso, img, wim, etc files in the "USB\OSimages\" folder.
You can download some from the websites "https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php" or "https://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-science/microsoft/67-microsoft-windows-and-office-iso-download-tool"...
Then, all you have to do is go to the "Install Windows" menu that appears in Medicat USB.
Instead, you can also do it via a software available in the winPE of mini windows 10.
