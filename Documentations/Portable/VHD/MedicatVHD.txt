Medicat VHD is a VHD file containing a system created from Windows 11. It is 30GB in size with 13GB of free space.
To run it, USB 3.0 is STRONGLY recommended as a bare minimum, with USB 3.2 Gen 2 being highly advisable!
MediCat VHD is NOT a Win10PE like Mini Windows 10. It is a full Windows 10 installation for PC repair, which uses the real hardware of your computer. It is much less limiting in terms of functionality.
To start it from Medicat USB, place the .vhd file in the "USB\VHD\" folder and check that the file "ventoy_vhdboot.img" is present in the "USB\ventoy\" folder. Medicat VHD will then appear in the menu and you can start it.
Once started, customize it as much as you want like a real windows. All changes will be saved... You can now do your actions in a much less limited way.
