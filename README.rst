Medicat USB is a community project. It is a bootable USB stick containing many tools to troubleshoot Windows PCs. It uses Ventoy to operate. So you just drag bootable files onto the USB stick and edit configuration files if you want to add icons, custom names, passwords... You can download it from Gbatemp (https://gbatemp.net/threads/medicat-usb-a-multiboot-linux-usb-for-pc-repair.361577/).

The Discord server for this project is public and can be accessed at the following link: https://discord.gg/hZWkufx3ye

This repo contains my different projects for Medicat: the different menus used and scripts.

---
Use
---

All menus must be operated from a winPE. Warning: one of the executables in AAA3A's Backup, being too large for GitHub, has been deleted. The files are therefore incomplete, but only one of the software is incriminated. To download the zips of Jayro's Lockpick, AAA3A's Backup, AAA3A's Partition and MediCat Documentations (to be extracted with 7zip), you can do it from Mega: https://mega.nz/folder/FtRCgLQL#KTq897WQiXCJT8OQ3cT9Tg

Scripts for checking bootable tools, renaming zipped files or updating only Medicat USB must be used from a normal system. Follow the instructions displayed in each program.
